### Propofol model

Propofol PBPK predictions in children were evaluated using pharmacokinetic (PK) data reported in the following studies: 

- Allegaert K, de Hoon J, Verbesselt R, Naulaers G, Murat I. Maturational pharmacokinetics of single intravenous bolus of propofol. Paediatr Anaesth. 2007 Nov;17(11):1028-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9592.2007.02285.x.[[Allegaert 2007](#3-references)]

- Kataria BK, Ved SA, Nicodemus HF, Hoy GR, Lea D, Dubois MY, Mandema JW, Shafer SL.  he pharmacokinetics of propofol in children using three different data analysis approaches. Anesthesiology. 1994 Jan;80(1):104-22. doi: 10.1097/00000542-199401000-00018.[[Kataria 1994](#3-references)]

- Saint-Maurice C, Cockshott ID, Douglas EJ, Richard MO, Harmey JL. Pharmacokinetics of propofol in young children after a single dose. Br J Anaesth. 1989 Dec;63(6):667-70. doi: 10.1093/bja/63.6.667. [[Saint-Maurice 1989](#3-references)]

The pediatric PBPK model predicted the clearance values of propofol observed in pediatric studies reasonably across all available age groups, ranging from 8 days to 10 years old. The ratios of mean predicted over observed area under the observed plasma concentrations (AUC) are illustrated in the table below as well as in the predicted versus observed AUC ratio plot, showing that most predictions in children were within 2-fold error of observed values.
